    "`UDrone` is an open source software written in Python for automatic image calibration of drone video images from a set of images that are manually calibrated.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "The calibration algorithm assumes that the intrinsic parameters of the camera remain unchanged while the extrinsic parameters (position and orientation) vary. The result of the process is the common intrinsic camera parameters for all images and the extrinsic parameters for each individual images extracted from a video. In addition, for each image a planview can be generated and, for the video, planviews for mean (_timex_) and sigma (_variance_) of the video images and timestacks are generated as well. The development of this software is suitable for processing videos obtained from moving cameras such as those acquired from drones. Details on the algorithm and methodology are described in\n",
